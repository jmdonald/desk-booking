## To Do
There are a couple of things here that could be tackled if I had given it more time
 - Navagation Component
   - Open Navigation bar from Left as per the designs
   - close navigation on clicking a link

 - Booking Form
   - Add more robust form validation
   - Select a better time picker
   - mock out calls to get available desks after location, date and times were selected

- Booking Table
  - Display message when no bookings are available

- Testing
  - Application testing could be finalised
